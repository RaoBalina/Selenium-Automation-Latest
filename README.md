•	I implemented Page object model design pattern which contain pages as java class file and Testcases as java class files.
•	For this frame work I user maven, TestNg framework
•	By using maven, we can run the code from console not going to editor.
•	By using testNg I run the testcases in the order and also, we can do data driven from excel sheet 
•	I set headless in the test base file when we run the testNG.xmal file stakeholders cannot see the application bot in the console code will be run
•	I using extent report for I used listener class


Run the TestNG.XML file which contains all testcasess

Frame work having logfile creation but not implemented in testcases level and also in the extent report level due to lack of time 
if you want see the logfile  related script placed in the testbase file
